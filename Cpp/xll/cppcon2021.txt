Session Description

As Bjarne said, "There are two kinds of languages..."
Excel has far more users, and complainers, than C++.
Like C++, it has been going through a renaissance.

Microsoft hired some heavy-hitters from the Haskell community to enhance its purely functional nature.
Dynamic 2-dimensional arrays are now first class objects in Excel. 
LAMBDA creates handles to functions that can be called like built-in functions.

C++ and Excel are complementary.
This talk will show you how to embed C++ in Excel
and create integrated documentation users can complain about.
